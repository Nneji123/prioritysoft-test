# Priority Store

Priority Store is a Django Rest Framework project designed to manage the inventory of items and suppliers efficiently. This project includes various features such as a custom user model, Celery for task handling, Docker for containerization, and more. This documentation provides an extensive overview of the project's structure, setup, and usage.

## Features

- **Custom User Model**: A tailored user model to meet specific authentication needs.
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks such as password reset emails and supplier notification emails.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Configured with `black` and `isort` to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Makefile**: Simplifies common tasks and commands.
- **Docker Compose**: Supports multiple environments (production and development).
- **Separated Settings**: Different settings for development and production environments.
- **Automated Tests**: Uses GitHub Actions, `pytest`, and `codecov` for continuous integration and code coverage.
- **Modular Apps Structure**: Enhances code modularity and maintainability.
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Provides extensive API documentation using Swagger and Redoc with drf-spectacular.
- **Custom Admin Interface**: Utilizes Django admin interface package for a customized admin experience.
- **Staticfiles Hosting**: Uses Whitenoise for serving static files.
- **Postgres and Redis Services**: Facilitates easy setup with Docker.
- **Mailpit**: Email testing functionality with visual representation of Mailpit UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git

### Setup

#### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/priority-store.git
cd priority-store
```

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` for guidance.

#### Using Docker

Build and run the containers:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

For production:

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

#### Using Makefile

To run the project using Makefile:

```sh
make build
make start
```

#### Using Python Commands

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can set up the project with Python:

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Apply migrations:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

3. Run the development server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

### Running with Gitpod

To run the project in Gitpod:

1. Open the repository in Gitpod.
2. Gitpod will automatically set up the environment and start the development server.

### Running with Code Spaces

To run the project in GitHub Codespaces:

1. Open the repository in Codespaces.
2. Codespaces will set up the environment and start the development server.

## Testing

To run the tests:

```sh
pytest
```

Coverage reports will be generated by Codecov.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Ensure your code meets quality standards by setting up pre-commit hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

## OpenAPI Documentation

This project includes extensive API documentation generated with drf-spectacular. You can access the Swagger UI and Redoc documentation at the following endpoints:

- Swagger UI: `/swagger/`
- Redoc: `/redoc/`

### Adding Images

## Custom Admin Interface

This project includes a custom admin interface using Django admin interface package. You can access the admin panel at `/admin/`.

## Static Files

Static files are served using Whitenoise. Ensure your static files are collected:

```sh
python manage.py collectstatic
```

## Services

### Postgres

Postgres is used as the database service. It is configured in the Docker Compose files.

### Redis

Redis is used as a message broker for Celery tasks. It is also configured in the Docker Compose files.

### Mailpit

Mailpit is used for email testing. The `.pen` files required for Mailpit to start are located in the `data` directory.
